                <P><B>Brandon Medeiros</B> <i>February 7 2024</i></P>
                <p><i>  A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors</i> is a cheesy 80's horror movie and one of the best Nightmare on elmstreet movies. Its stylish and campy tone add a lot to what makes it so timeless. For any fan of b-horror movies or camp movies Nightmare on elmstreet is a great series. This was the first one in the series where they began to play into the campness and comedy of Freddy, The scenes are kills are creative and have a lot of imagination.</p>
                
                <p> As the franchise went on the series began to get more silly and less scary but <i>A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors</i> really does capture the right balance between silly and horror. It is also from a time when practical effects where more common in movies and a reliance on CGI was not needed. Which adds to its timeless style.</p>

                    <h3>TRIVIA</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>(at around 1h 25 mins) When Freddy's skeleton comes alive in the junkyard, the skeleton has the claw on its right hand, which is not possible because he was not buried with his claw. It was removed by Marge Thompson and stored in their wood stove. She says to Nancy "I took his claw" then shows her in A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). Then it was discovered by Jesse Walsh in A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985).</li>
                        <li>The Freddy glove that was stolen from the set of this film was found in another movie: it was hanging on the wall of the work shed in Evil Dead II (1987), released the same year. It was part of a continued banter between directors Wes Craven and Sam Raimi. See The Hills Have Eyes (1977), The Evil Dead (1981), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), and Evil Dead II (1987) for more.</li>
                        <li>All the grips are nicknamed "Bob", except for the last, which is a variation on the name.</li>
